Ivan Torbey's Manim Videos Repository
Hello! My name is Ivan Torbey, and I am passionate about Mathematics and the positive impact of technology on education. This repository houses all the code I've written for creating educational videos using Manim, an animation engine for explanatory math videos.

About Manim
Manim is an animation engine developed by 3Blue1Brown (Grant Sanderson) to create precise, illustrative, and beautiful mathematical visualizations. It's an open-source Python library, which means you can use it to create your own videos as well.

Contents of this Repository
In this repository, you'll find code for various mathematical animations and visualizations I've created. I've divided the content into different categories based on the mathematical concepts they represent.

How to Use
To use the contents of this repository, clone it to your local machine, and run the Python scripts using Manim. Please ensure that you have Manim correctly installed and configured on your machine. You can find more information about how to install and use Manim in the Manim documentation.
